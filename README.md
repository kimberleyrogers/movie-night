# movie_night_project

My initial idea is to utilise a dataset that my friends and I have been building for a few years. Each Monday we hold a movie night, and take turns to create a movie poll (with a loose theme) whilst the rest of us vote on which movie we'd like to watch from the poll. We've watched dozens of movies because of this tradition.
My site would consist of:

    home page with a big fat cheesy logo
    movies page - one page listing every movie watched
    links to:
        individual movie page - movie poster, synopsis, year, country, member who chose the movie
    about page - with pictures and text about the movie night tradition
    members page - with 6 mugshots, one for each movie night member
    links to:
        individual member page - big picture, small blurb/bio
    sign up page - for each of the members to create an account
    login page
    add page - once logged in you can add data to the movie database - for example for the movie we just watched

My main concern is that the sign up page should really only be for the 6 members of movie night - I wouldn't want anyone else to add data to my database. Perhaps I could manage this by marking those accounts as 'admin'?
My other concern is that this site is fun for me and my friends, but for nobody else. Does that make it a bad choice for the project and for something that will be part of my portfolio?
