## overview
This project was built to celebrate an ongoing weekly tradition with a group of friends.
Each Monday we hold a movie night, and take turns to create a movie poll (with a loose theme) whilst the rest of us vote on which movie we'd like to watch from the poll. We've watched dozens of movies through Monday movie night.

I wanted to create a place to see a record of all the films we've watched, who's film pick and some movie data; like country of origin, genre, runtime etc.

The site consists of:
+ home page with logo
+ about page
+ the movie list - every film watched at movie night
+
